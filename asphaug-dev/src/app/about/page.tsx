          <p className="text-lg text-slate-400">
            I&apos;m a Senior Cloud Engineer based in Sørumsand, passionate about secure systems, cloud architecture, and building tech that just works.

            With over 8 years of experience, I&apos;ve worked across public sector, defense, and tech startups — currently solving cloud and infrastructure challenges at Sopra Steria. My career began in the Norwegian Armed Forces, where I focused on operational IT and secure communications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            I specialize in scalable system design, AWS, DevOps practices, backend and (some) frontend development. Whether it&apos;s greenfield projects or modernizing legacy platforms, I focus on building reliable, secure, and maintainable systems.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            My background also includes work with radio communication systems, secure networking, and mission-critical deployments — from on-prem in a desert to the cloud.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            When I&apos;m not working, I&apos;m busy tinkering on quirky side projects, leveling up in games, and tearing down the highway on my motorcycle — all powered by Red Bull, snus, and a dash of delightful chaos.
